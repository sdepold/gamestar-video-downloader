gamestar-video-downloader
=========================

This project will download the first 4 pages of the current video list of gamestar.
You need to have Node.JS installed. If you have that, do the following:

```console
cd some/where/gamestar-video-downloader
npm install
node app.js
```

This will download the videos. Trailers are skipped.

## Future development

There is a small chance that the output will be improved. Also I played
with the idea of using app.js to turn it into a desktop application.
